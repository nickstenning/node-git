# node-git

This is an attempt to make a direct(ish) port of Scott Chacon's [ruby-git](http://github.com/schacon/ruby-git) to the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) environment.

## Nota Bene
It **does not work** at the moment, and is not even close do doing so. I have merely hacked together some scripts which have done much of the boring work of translating Scott's Ruby into Javascript.

## TODO
The first task is to translate the test suite into [Vows](http://vowsjs.org)-compatible code. Once we have a running (and failing) test suite, we can start to modify Scott's code into a form that passes the tests.

## Contributing
Your help is greatly appreciated. Please fork the repo and get to work on the tests!
